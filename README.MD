#Code to compute the stress and strain of a spherically symmetry body subject to diurnal eccentricity tides 

#To run the code, execute the following command into the terminal:

# >>./tides.a elastic_model_Io.dat

# Then run:

# >> python Run.py

# The file specifying the internal structure of Io is in elastic_model_Io.dat
# The file specifying the mean anomaly, co-latitude, and longitude of the evaluated locaiton is in Run.py

# The saved files correspond to the three components of the horizontal stress tensor (labelled 'tau') at the surface, and the three components of the horizontal strain tensor (labelled 'eps') at the surface.
